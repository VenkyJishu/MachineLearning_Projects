In this Project,
We have used car Dataset which had used car information and needs to predict Price for it based on multiple features of it.

Dataset is available in same repo under Datasets Folder.


We have tried to use Linear Regression with

1. Encoder Technique for feature Engineering
2. Correlation for features selection
3. Decision Tree Model
4. Outliers Removal using Z-score
5. Metrics (MSE,MAE and R-Squared for measuring results).
